Gears is a Rust implementation of the [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk). The full functionality of the
Cosmos SDK has not yet been implemented however Gears can be used to create basic Blockchains.

[This](./gaia-rs) (part) implementation of a Cosmos Hub (Gaia) node shows how Gears can be used to build a Blockchain.

# AZKR

Work on Gears is primarily funded through [AZKR research](https://azkr.org/). AZKR are using Gears to build AZKR-chain which is a unique web3 ecosystem to help DAOs achieve mass adoption. [Their dashboard](http://dashboard.azkr.org/devnet) demonstrates how Gears can work seamlessly with existing Cosmos eco system tooling, in this case the [ping.pub](https://ping.pub/) dashboard.
